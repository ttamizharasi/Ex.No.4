### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### Aim: 
To develop a scenario-based report demonstrating the effective use of diverse prompting techniques in interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate relevant and high-quality content.
## **Experiment:**

1. Understand various prompting techniques used to guide LLMs.
2. Create scenarios where different prompt styles improve the quality and specificity of AI responses.
3. Develop reports or content pieces using these techniques.
4. Compare and analyze the effectiveness of each prompting method.


## **Algorithm **

### **Step 1: Understand Prompting Techniques**

* Simple prompts: Direct questions or statements.
* Zero-shot prompting: Asking the model to perform a task without examples.
* Few-shot prompting: Providing examples in the prompt for better context.
* Chain-of-thought prompting: Encouraging step-by-step reasoning.
* Instruction-based prompting: Clear, detailed instructions to guide output.

### **Step 2: Define Scenarios**

* Scenario 1: Technical report writing using simple prompts.
* Scenario 2: Summarization using zero-shot prompts.
* Scenario 3: Code generation using few-shot prompts.
* Scenario 4: Complex problem solving with chain-of-thought prompting.
* Scenario 5: Creative story generation with instruction-based prompts.

### **Step 3: Develop Content**

* For each scenario, prepare the prompt(s).
* Interact with the LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) to generate outputs.
* Collect and organize generated content.

### **Step 4: Analyze Results**

* Evaluate clarity, relevance, and accuracy.
* Note how prompting style affects response quality.
* Document challenges and advantages of each technique.

### **Step 5: Compile Report**

* Introduction to prompting and its importance.
* Description of each scenario and prompt used.
* Presentation of generated outputs.
* Comparative analysis of techniques.
* Conclusion and best practices.
